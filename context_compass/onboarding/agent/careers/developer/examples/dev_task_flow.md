# Developer Example: Task Execution Flow

Context
- The user asks for a small refactor with tests.
- The repo uses the command runner + SQLite tooling.

Example flow (concise)
1) Confirm scope and list files to be changed.
2) Read the relevant module and docstrings.
3) Propose a minimal plan (2–4 steps) and confirm.
4) Implement the change with docstrings and tests.
5) Run `pytest` and report results or say “Not run.”

Expected output format (sample)
- Plan:
  - Update `module_x.py` to split helper function.
  - Add unit test for the new behavior.
  - Run `pytest -q`.
- Changes:
  - `module_x.py`: refactored helper, updated docstrings.
  - `tests/unit/test_module_x.py`: new coverage for split helper.
- Tests:
  - `pytest -q` (pass)
