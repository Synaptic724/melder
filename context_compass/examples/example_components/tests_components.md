# Example tests_components

## Metadata
- Example only; demonstrates tests component mapping format.

## Scope
Map key test-validation components for workflow integrity.

## DO NOT ASSUME / Unknowns Gate
Keep unresolved test assumptions as UNKNOWN.

## Unknowns
- UNKNOWN: final CI matrix for multi-runtime validation.

## C3 Components Catalog
### Reference integrity scanner
- Purpose: detect broken internal references.
- Responsibilities: scan docs and resolve paths.
- Inputs: markdown/yaml files.
- Outputs: missing reference findings.
- Owned State: scan report.
- Lifecycle/Cleanup: run on release hardening.
- Concurrency/Threading: serial scan pass.
- Invariants/Guarantees: findings include file references.
- Failure Modes: false negatives from incomplete patterns.
- Observability: ticket validation notes.
- Key Files (C1): `tickets/*/README.md`, `templates/*.md`.

## C2 Subcomponents Catalog
