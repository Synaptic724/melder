# Epic: Context Compass Release Readiness Example Pack

## Metadata
- Epic ID: EPIC-2026-02-19-context-compass-release-readiness-example-pack
- Status: review
- Owner: context_compass_maintainer
- Priority: p1
- Created: 2026-02-19T00:00:00Z
- Updated: 2026-02-19T03:10:00Z
- Target Window: 2026-Q1
- Related Program/Initiative: public-library-release-hardening

## Problem / Opportunity
Top-level examples were shallow and referenced an unrelated legacy narrative.
Users could not follow a complete epic -> story -> task flow grounded in this
repository.

## MRP Alignment (Most Reasonable Product)
The durable core is a repo-local example set that demonstrates real usage:
entrypoints and routing, template-complete tickets, artifact lifecycle, and
compaction-safe handoff notes.

## Ticket Contract
- ENTRY_GATE: `SKILLS.md` and `AGENTS.md` are present and readable.
- EXECUTION_BOUNDARY: docs/examples only.
- DEPENDENCIES: `templates/*_template.md`, `tickets/*/README.md`, `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/workflow.md`.
- EXIT_GATE: complete example epic/story/task exists under `examples/example_*`; flow docs and system docs are aligned.
- FAILURE_ESCALATION: raise `DECISION_REQUEST` for ambiguity and `BLOCKER` for unresolved references.

## Goals (Outcomes)
- Build one complete, high-quality epic/story/task chain based on this repo.
- Publish a rich overview for users copying `context_compass/`.
- Ensure top-level example flows reference only real example assets.

## Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)
- No runtime code changes.
- No policy semantics redesign.

## Scope Boundaries
- In scope:
  - `examples/example_epics/`, `examples/example_stories/`, `examples/example_tasks/`, `examples/example_completed/`
  - `examples/eng_task_flow.md`, `examples/design_task_flow.md`, `examples/artifact_workflow.md`, `examples/adr_example.md`, `examples/repo_overview.md`
  - `system_docs/src_architecture.md`, `system_docs/src_components.md`
- Out of scope:
  - CI/release scripting changes
  - role-policy refactors

## State Transition Event
- from_state: in_progress
- to_state: review
- transition_reason: story and task are complete; awaiting user acceptance.

## Success Metrics
- Full example chain exists and links correctly.
- Legacy sample slugs removed from top-level examples.
- Architecture/components docs use clean, copy-safe paths.

## Milestones (Track Progress)
- [x] Replace weak sample narrative with repo-based chain.
- [x] Upgrade architecture/components docs with concrete repo grounding.
- [x] Publish rich overview and flow alignment.

## Stories (Required to Complete)
- [x] Story: STORY-2026-02-19-context-compass-release-readiness-examples - create complete example chain and align docs.

## Tasks (Cross-Cutting or Epic-Level)
- [x] Task: Complete story STORY-2026-02-19-context-compass-release-readiness-examples
- [x] Task: Verify top-level example references and lane isolation.
- [x] Task: Verify Ticket Microcycle enforcement across linked ticket docs.

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic Done)
- Example epic/story/task/artifact are present in `examples/example_*` lanes.
- Rich overview exists in `examples/repo_overview.md`.
- Top-level flow docs and system docs are coherent and evidence-ready.

## Risks / Mitigations
- Risk: docs drift and links break.
  - Mitigation: run release grep checks for stale slugs and bad path patterns.

## Applicable Anti-Patterns
- [x] No epic-state transition without story-level evidence.
- [x] No closure while required stories are incomplete or unaccepted.
- [x] No program claims without source evidence from story/task notes.

## Validation / Test Approach
- `rg -n "context_compass_release_readiness|repo_overview" examples`
- `rg -n "context_compass/AGENTS.md" examples`
- `rg -n "\x07|\x08|\x09|\x0d" system_docs examples/example_architecture examples/example_components`

## Artifact Links (Optional)
- ARTIFACTS_REQUIRED: true
- ARTIFACT_PATHS:
  - `examples/example_completed/2026-02-19_context_compass_release_overview_artifact.md`
- DISPOSITION: retain_as_reference
- CLEANUP_TRIGGER: next docs refresh cycle.

## Notes
- DATETIME: 2026-02-19T02:40:00Z
  TYPE: FACT
  CLAIM: top-level examples were not repository-grounded and lacked full ticket-chain depth.
  EVIDENCE:
  - `examples/eng_task_flow.md:1-30`
  - `examples/adr_example.md:1-20`
  IMPACT: poor onboarding and weak handoff reliability.
  NEXT: replace with complete repo-based examples.
  REREAD: REQUIRED
  SCORE_0_TO_10: 9
- DATETIME: 2026-02-19T03:10:00Z
  TYPE: FACT
  CLAIM: new example chain and rich overview are in place and linked.
  EVIDENCE:
  - `examples/example_stories/2026-02-19_context_compass_release_readiness_examples_story.md:1-170`
  - `examples/example_tasks/2026-02-19_context_compass_release_readiness_pack_task.md:1-200`
  - `examples/repo_overview.md:1-130`
  IMPACT: public users can follow a complete, repo-native workflow.
  NEXT: request user acceptance and close.
  REREAD: HELPFUL
  SCORE_0_TO_10: 9

## Closure Confirmation
- [x] Work walkthrough shared with user
- [ ] Acceptance criteria confirmed by user
- [x] Applicable anti-pattern checks are clear or escalated with evidence.

## Context / Handoff Summary
This epic now anchors a full repo-based example workflow under `examples/`.
Story and task are complete; only user acceptance remains for closure.
