# Artifact Board

Purpose
- Canonical index of active artifact associations.
- Track artifact lifecycle decisions that support ticket execution.
- Keep `attention_board.md` ticket-only and free of artifact pointers.

Scope rules
- `attention_board.md` routes tickets only; do not add artifact paths there.
- Tickets remain canonical memory; this board is an association index.
- Add rows only when a ticket has one or more active artifact files.
- Every artifact row must include a ticket path and retention decision.

Disposition values
- `delete_on_close`: remove artifact when ticket closes.
- `retain_as_reference`: keep artifact with explicit reason.
- `promote_to_documentation`: convert artifact into durable docs.
