## User Narrative
As a <user/persona>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.

## Value / MRP Alignment
<Explain how this story strengthens the holistic core.>

## Ticket Contract
- ENTRY_GATE: <active board row and linked task/story prerequisites satisfied>
- EXECUTION_BOUNDARY: <story-level surfaces allowed; no unrelated expansion>
- DEPENDENCIES: <task set and prerequisite tickets/stories/epic milestones>
- EXIT_GATE: <acceptance + child-task state + board-sync requirements>
- FAILURE_ESCALATION: <when to raise DECISION_REQUEST/CONFLICT/BLOCKER>

## Scope Boundaries

- Out of scope:

## State Transition Event
- from_state: draft | ready | in_progress | blocked | review
- to_state: ready | in_progress | blocked | review | done
- transition_reason: <why this transition is valid now>

## Tasks (Implementation Checklist)
- [ ] Task: <TASK-ID> - <short description>
- [ ] Task: <TASK-ID> - <short description>
- [ ] Enforce Ticket Microcycle across all linked tasks.
- [ ] Require meaningful-finding note updates during discovery/implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Validation / Test Plan

## UX / API / Data Notes

## Risks / Mitigations
- 

## Applicable Anti-Patterns
- [ ] No story-state transition without linked task-state evidence.
- [ ] No closure while required tasks remain active or un-routed.
- [ ] No cross-task synthesis claims without ticket-note evidence pointers.

## Closure Confirmation
- [ ] Work walkthrough shared with user
- [ ] Acceptance criteria confirmed by user
- [ ] Applicable anti-pattern checks are clear or escalated with evidence.

## Noting Behavior
- Note focus: cross-task synthesis, dependency flow, and state-transition logic.
- Add notes when task routing changes, gate decisions are made, or risks shift.
- Reference child-task notes for evidence instead of duplicating tactical detail.
- Keep notes append-only and preserve UNKNOWN-first promotion discipline.
