## Steps / Checklist
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] Run Ticket Microcycle during execution:
      `Investigate -> Document -> Strategy/Plan -> Document -> Implement ->
      Document -> Validate -> Document`.
- [ ] Document each meaningful finding immediately in `## Notes` before further investigation.

## Deliverables

## Files / Paths Impacted

## Validation

## Risks / Rollback Notes
- 

## Applicable Anti-Patterns
- [ ] No status transition without evidence-backed transition reason.
- [ ] No implementation/validation from `UNKNOWN` or `HYPOTHESIS`.
- [ ] No closure without acceptance confirmation and board-sync completion.

## Done Checklist
- [ ] Steps complete and checked off
- [ ] Deliverables produced and linked
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] Validation status recorded
- [ ] Unknown-first discipline followed (`UNKNOWN` promoted to `FACT` only with evidence)
- [ ] Notes quality maintained (`SCORE_0_TO_10` >=
      `workflow.ticket_microcycle.minimum_note_score`)
- [ ] Applicable anti-pattern checks are clear or escalated with evidence.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria reviewed with user and confirmed
- [ ] Board sync completed for successor routing or closure anchor update.

## Artifact Links (Optional)

## Noting Behavior
- Note focus: tactical findings, concrete impacts, and single-step continuation.

- Keep notes append-only; correct history only for factual errors.
- Promote `UNKNOWN` to `FACT` only with direct evidence pointers.
