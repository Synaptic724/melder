# testing_overview

Purpose
- Define the testing taxonomy and value ranking.

Testing Discipline (Pytest, Unit-First, Integration-Second)

We are building confidence, not just coverage. All changes must be accompanied by tests unless explicitly exempted.

Preferred Framework: pytest
* Use pytest as the default test runner.
* Use fixtures for setup/teardown and dependency injection.
* Keep tests deterministic: no reliance on wall-clock time, network, or external services unless explicitly marked and scoped as integration tests.

What We Value in Tests (Ranked)
If you take nothing else from this section, take this:
> A test is valuable if it would fail for a real regression and would not fail for a harmless refactor.

Rank S - System Contract Tests (Highest Value)
Signals:
* Exercises real wiring across multiple components (minimal real set).
* Catches regression in control flow, data flow, and lifecycle behavior.
* Fails for real breakage, not for refactors.

Examples:
* A "root revalidation" flow that uses real blueprints and validates outcomes.
* A concurrency primitive integration test that proves ordering/invariants.

Use these sparingly and intentionally. They cost more to maintain.

Rank A - Behavioral Unit Contract Tests (High Value)
Signals:
* Asserts behavior through public methods and documented outputs.
* Validates meaningful branches and error paths.
* Avoids coupling to private fields/implementation details.

Examples:
* "Given these inputs, return/raise exactly X."
* "After cleanup, public methods raise or behave as documented."
* "Last-write-wins semantics for a registry."

Rank B - State Transition Tests (Medium-High Value)
Signals:
* Proves valid transitions and prevents illegal transitions.
* Focuses on lifecycle invariants (cleaned vs active, idempotence, ordering).
* Uses introspection APIs (describe(), snapshots) rather than poking raw private fields.

Rank C - Collaboration/Boundary Mock Tests (Medium Value)
Signals:
* Mocks are used at real boundaries (I/O, network, filesystem, subprocess, time, OS).
* Asserts calls that matter (ordering, arguments, exactly-once / at-most-once) when that is part of the contract.

Warning:
* These become brittle if you over-specify calls.

Rank D - Regression Reproduction Tests (Targeted Value)
Signals:
* Title references the bug symptom.
* Minimal reproduction.
* Assertions match the corrected behavior.

Rank E - Line-Coverage Fillers (Low Value)
Signals:
* Asserts "it did not crash" with no contract outcome.
* Asserts values that are incidental.
We avoid these unless they are stepping stones toward higher-rank tests.

Rank F - Attribute/Existence Checks (Very Low Value)
Examples (bad):
* assert obj._some_private_field is not None (unless the field is part of a documented public contract, which is rare)
* assert hasattr(obj, "x") / assert "x" in obj.__dict__ / assert isinstance(obj._pending_changes, dict)

Why this is bad:
* Does not prove correctness.
* Over-couples tests to implementation.
* Encourages "coverage mirage."

Only acceptable when:
* The attribute is explicitly part of a public, documented contract (rare), or
* You are validating cleanup nulling as part of a lifecycle safety contract and there is no better public signal.

Rules: Unit Tests First (Mock + Isolated)
The default approach is mocked / isolated unit tests.

* Mock external boundaries (I/O, filesystem, network, subprocesses, clocks, OS calls, databases, thread scheduling, random sources).
* Validate contracts (inputs/outputs/raises), invariants, and side effects (including cleanup ordering) at the smallest reasonable unit.
* Prefer contract-level assertions over implementation-detail assertions.
* Avoid flakiness: tests must run reliably on repeated runs.

Contract-level assertion checklist
When writing a unit test, you should be able to answer "yes" to most of these:
* Does the test assert an observable outcome (return, raise, snapshot, state transition)?
* Would the test fail if a real regression happened?
* Would the test still pass after a harmless refactor (renaming locals, reordering statements, changing internal data structures)?
* Are mocks only used at true boundaries?
* Are we asserting behavior rather than "internal shape"?
If not, the test is probably Rank E/F.

Integration Tests Second (Only When Needed)
Integration tests are required when behavior cannot be proven safely via mocks/unit tests.

Use integration tests when at least one is true:
* Correctness depends on real interactions across multiple components (e.g., concurrency scheduling, orchestration behavior, serializer/codec correctness across layers).
* Mocking would require re-implementing the system under test or would make the test meaningless.
* The integration is the contract (e.g., plugin wiring, adapter boundaries, real concurrency primitives).

Rules for integration tests:
* Keep them scoped: integrate only the minimal set of real components needed.
* Make them explicit: use clear naming and markers (e.g., @pytest.mark.integration) if the repo uses them.
* Ensure they remain repeatable and not environment-dependent unless explicitly documented.

Coverage Target: 95%+ (Non-Negotiable) Coverage is defined as method and attr coverage not the pytest definition. Use your discernment.

Agent Execution Constraint (Read Carefully)
AI agents cannot truthfully confirm repository-wide coverage levels (including the >=95% target) unless the user runs the test suite and reports the result.
* Agents must not claim coverage numbers.
* Agents must not imply pytest or pytest --cov was executed.
* If the user asks "did you run tests/coverage?", the only valid answer is "Not run."

Agent Policy: Prefer Test Density Now; Verify Coverage Later
In the agent environment, coverage measurement is treated as a follow-up step that the user performs. Agents should default to producing a strong test suite using the density heuristic, and then ask the user to verify >=95% coverage later.

Default Path - Test Density (Preferred for Agent Work):
Use this path unless the user explicitly provides coverage output.
* Baseline density: target >= 10 tests per 100 LOC for the changed/covered module(s).
* Dense / high cyclomatic complexity code: increase target to >= 20 tests per 100 LOC when the code shows any of the following:
  * high cyclomatic complexity (many branches/guards)
  * heavy error-path logic
  * concurrency / locking / ordering constraints
  * lifecycle/cleanup state machines
  * non-trivial invariants (dirty tracking, revalidation, promotion semantics)
These are heuristics - not a license to create filler tests. Every test must still meet the quality criteria below.

Follow-Up Path - Coverage Verification (User-Run, Later):
* Target: >= 95% line coverage for the relevant package/module(s).
* Requirement: the user runs the suite (e.g., pytest --cov) and reports the output.
* Agent reporting: if the user has not run it, you must say "Not run." and you must not guess.

If the user reports coverage below target, agents should add tests by increasing branch/error/lifecycle coverage - not by adding filler assertions.

We target >= 95% line coverage across the library.
* Heuristic: we want at least 10 tests per 100 LOC, but do not game it. If you have 95%+ coverage but fewer than 10 tests per 100 LOC, that is acceptable.
* Coverage must not be "gamed" (no meaningless tests whose only purpose is to execute lines).

Where we focus coverage:
* Public API contracts
* Critical branching logic
* Error paths
* Lifecycle/cleanup behavior
* Concurrency-sensitive behavior (as testable)

If a component cannot reasonably hit the coverage target (rare), document the reason and the mitigation (integration coverage, property tests, or explicit exclusion with rationale) and ask before applying exclusions.

6) Truthful Validation Reporting
When reporting validation status:
* Only claim unit/integration/coverage runs if you actually ran them.
* If not run, say "Not run."
* If recommending commands, be specific and repo-consistent (e.g., pytest, pytest -q, pytest -m integration, pytest --cov). Do not invent a workflow that contradicts repository docs.

7) Fixing Broken Base Code (While Writing Tests)
If you find mistakes while writing tests (bugs, incorrect docstrings, missing cleanup, race conditions):
* Raise them as issues rather than fixing them silently.
* If you have explicit permission to fix them, follow all rules in this document (docstrings, cleanup, scope control, tests).
* Do not fix unrelated mistakes outside your declared scope.
* If the mistakes block your work, explain the situation and ask for guidance.

Rules
- pytest is the default framework.
- Prefer unit tests; use integration when needed.
- Use component tests for small slices of real wiring without external IO.
- Tests must be deterministic and contract-driven.
- Avoid tests that only assert internal attributes or existence.

Value ranking (high to low)
- Rank S: System contract tests
- Rank A: Behavioral unit contract tests
- Rank B: State transition tests
- Component tests: real collaborators in a small slice (often Rank A/B)
- Rank C: Collaboration/boundary mocks
- Rank D: Regression reproduction tests
- Rank E/F: Avoid low-value filler and existence checks

Placement
- Component tests: tests/component/
- Integration tests: tests/integration/
