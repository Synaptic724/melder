## Purpose
Rebuild or repair `attention_board.md` from current active ticket truth when
the board drifts or becomes stale.

## Required Reads
- `attention_board.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/active_pointerboard.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/ticketing.md`

## Required Skills
- `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/active_pointerboard.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/ticketing.md`

## Phase Sequence
1. Intake
- objective:
  - confirm the board is the target
- required actions:
  - ask what drift or stale state the user wants corrected when not already explicit
- stop conditions:
  - target board problem is unclear

2. Investigation
- objective:
  - derive the true active set from tickets
- required actions:
  - inspect the current active tickets
  - compare them to the current board rows
- required note or artifact updates:
  - record the mismatch set in the owning task notes

3. Strategy
- objective:
  - choose repair or full rebuild
- decision points:
  - small drift -> patch rows/details
  - large drift -> rebuild the active set from ticket truth

4. Implementation
- objective:
  - synchronize the board to ticket truth
- scope controls:
  - keep the board compact
  - keep artifact pointers out
  - preserve `owner` vs `agent_name`

5. Validation
- objective:
  - prove the board matches ticket truth
- required checks:
  - every active row maps to a live ticket
  - no completed-ticket paths remain in active rows

6. Handoff / Closure
- objective:
  - summarize what drift was fixed
- required board or ticket sync:
  - leave the board as the refreshed routing source of truth

## Attention Board Behavior
- Required row fields:
  - preserve the full active row schema
- Mode transitions:
  - usually `handoff` when sync is complete
- Exit signal rules:
  - the board matches current active ticket truth

## Context / Handoff Summary
This workflow repairs board drift without turning the board into a second ticket
system.
