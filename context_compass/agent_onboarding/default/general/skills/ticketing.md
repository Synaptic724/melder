# ticketing

Purpose
- Define the ticketing system used to plan, execute, and close work in this repo.

Ticket types
- Epic: big project or cross-cutting initiative with multiple stories.
- Story: medium scope, user- or system-facing slice that can stand alone or live under an epic.
- Task: small, single deliverable that can stand alone.

Templates
- `templates/epic_template.md`
- `templates/story_template.md`
- `templates/task_template.md`
- `configuration_standards.md`
- `artifact_board.md`

Deep descriptive model (required)
Each ticket must be specific, evidence-based, and durable. Avoid vague goals.

Required elements
- Problem / Opportunity
- Context (why now, relationship to architecture)
- MRP alignment
- Ticket Contract (`ENTRY_GATE`, `EXECUTION_BOUNDARY`, `DEPENDENCIES`,
  `EXIT_GATE`, `FAILURE_ESCALATION`)
- Goals / Non-goals
- Scope boundaries
- Requirements (functional + non-functional)
- Acceptance criteria (observable outcomes)
- Risks / Mitigations
- Validation plan (tests or verification)
- Decision log
- State Transition Event (`from_state`, `to_state`, `transition_reason`)
- Applicable Anti-Patterns (lane-specific checklist only)
- Noting Behavior (task/story/epic focus)
- Artifact Links (Optional, required when artifacts exist)
- Notes (active findings with evidence pointers)
- Context / Handoff summary

Workflow rules
1) Choose the smallest ticket type that fits the scope:
   - Big project: epic -> stories -> tasks.
   - Medium scope: story -> tasks.
   - Small scope: task only.
2) Keep links consistent (epic <-> story <-> task IDs) when using multiple levels.
3) Track progress with checkboxes and status fields.
4) Use the Ticket Microcycle while active:
   - `Investigate -> Document -> Strategy/Plan -> Document -> Implement -> Document -> Validate -> Document`.
5) For every meaningful finding, update `## Notes` immediately before any further investigation.
6) Treat new claims as `UNKNOWN` by default; promote to `FACT` only with evidence.
7) If investigation expands beyond the current subsystem or exceeds
   `workflow.ticket_microcycle.expansion_gate_max_files`, add a `DECISION`
   note and request user confirmation.
8) Update Context / Handoff Summary as work changes.
9) Before closing a ticket:
   - Walk through what was delivered.
   - Ask the user to confirm acceptance criteria.
10) After confirmation:
   - Add a completion summary + UTC datetime.
   - Move the ticket to its matching completed folder (`tickets/epics/completed/`,
     `tickets/stories/completed/`, or `tickets/tasks/completed/`).
11) Immediately run deterministic closure sync for `attention_board.md`:
   - Remove/replace active row(s) that point to the closed ticket.
   - Prune stale attention details tied only to the closed ticket.
   - Add one compact row under `Recently Closed Anchors`.
   - Keep anchor rows capped (oldest removed first).
12) If ticket artifacts exist, run artifact closure sync:
   - Apply artifact disposition (`delete_on_close`, `retain_as_reference`, or
     `promote_to_documentation`).
   - Update `artifact_board.md` active/cleared entries.

Mandatory execution gates
- Active ticket gate:
  - Do not implement or validate without an active ticket for the work.
- Routing gate:
  - Do not implement or validate unless `attention_board.md` has an active row
    that points to the same active ticket.
- Notes gate:
  - Do not start another investigation/edit/validation tranche until the current
    meaningful finding is appended to ticket `## Notes` with evidence pointers.
- Repair gate:
  - If any gate is broken or stale, stop and repair ticket/board/notes state
    before continuing.
- Artifact gate:
  - When artifacts are present, ticket `Artifact Links (Optional)` and
    `artifact_board.md` must stay synchronized.
- Attention-board boundary gate:
  - `attention_board.md` must remain ticket-routing-only (no artifact pointers).

Notes format requirement
- New note entries should include:
  - `DATETIME` (ISO-8601 UTC: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
  - `TYPE`:
    `FACT` | `UNKNOWN` | `HYPOTHESIS` | `DECISION` | `DECISION_REQUEST` |
    `PLAN` | `STRATEGY_DISCUSSION` | `ASSUMPTION_CHALLENGE` | `CONFLICT` |
    `TRADEOFF` | `BLOCKER` | `ALIGNMENT_CHECK` | `MEASURE` | `RISK` |
    `RAISE`
  - `CLAIM`
  - `EVIDENCE`:
    - inline form for one short path (`path:start_line-end_line`)
    - one path per line when path count >= 2 or line would exceed hard cap
  - `IMPACT`
  - `NEXT`
  - `REREAD` (`REQUIRED` | `HELPFUL`)
  - `SCORE_0_TO_10` (compaction usefulness score; improve entries below
    `workflow.ticket_microcycle.minimum_note_score`)
- Keep notes append-only except when correcting factual errors.
- Deep semantic meaning and collaboration behavior for each `TYPE` are defined in:
  `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/execution_contract.md`.

Per-ticket noting behavior
- Task notes: tactical findings, immediate impacts, and one-step continuation.
- Story notes: cross-task synthesis, dependency movement, and gate transitions.
- Epic notes: program direction, cross-story tradeoffs, and tranche order.

Status discipline
- Update Status and Updated fields on each state change (UTC DateTime: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).
- Prefer: draft -> ready -> in_progress -> blocked/done.
- If blocked, document the blocker and the unblock action.

Ticket contract discipline
- Every active ticket should contain `Ticket Contract`.
- Every status transition should be documented via `State Transition Event`.
- Keep anti-pattern checks local to the lane (`Applicable Anti-Patterns`);
  do not duplicate a global anti-pattern catalog in each ticket.

Config authority
- Source thresholds from `config/context_compass_config.yaml` under
  `workflow.ticket_microcycle`.
- Values are authoritative in YAML.
- Do not duplicate numeric defaults in policy docs.
- Ticket contract gates are authoritative under `workflow.ticket_contract`.
- Note behavior defaults are authoritative under `workflow.note_behavior`.
- Artifact protocol is authoritative under `artifacts`.

Formatting discipline
- Follow `configuration_standards.md`.
- Default prose target is 90-110 characters per line.
- Hard cap is 120 characters per line.
- `EVIDENCE` should use one path per line when multiple paths are present or
  inline length would exceed hard cap.

Validation reporting
- Never claim tests ran unless they actually ran.
- If not run, say "Not run" and explain why.
