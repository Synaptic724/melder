# memory_management

Purpose
- Define how durable context is stored and maintained in this repo.

Policy
- Use `tickets/epics/`, `tickets/stories/`, and `tickets/tasks/` tickets as the primary durable memory.
- Use `attention_board.md` as routing-only state to select the active ticket.
- Store decisions, assumptions, and handoff context in ticket sections.
- Maintain a `## Notes` section in active tickets for in-flight findings with
  `path:start_line-end_line` evidence pointers (`start=end` if single-line).
- Use UNKNOWN as the default claim state and promote to FACT only when evidence is attached.
- Approved memory artifacts:
  - tickets (`tickets/epics/`, `tickets/stories/`, `tickets/tasks/`) for durable decisions and findings.
  - `attention_board.md` for routing-only state.
  - `artifact_board.md` for artifact lifecycle state.
  - `compacting_differential_board.md` for compaction retention-quality diffs (not a decision log).
- Avoid ad-hoc memory stores or random logs outside these artifacts.

Safety rules
- Never store secrets in tickets or docs.
- Prefer concise, evidence-based notes over speculative memory.
