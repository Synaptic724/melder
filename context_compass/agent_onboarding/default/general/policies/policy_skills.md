# policy_skills

Purpose
- Enforce the policy chain so edits stay deterministic and reviewable.

When to use
- At the start of every session and before editing in a new directory.

Canonical Contract (from AGENTS.MD)
This repository is a public library. Code quality and documentation are
first-class deliverables.

Placement
- Keep `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root.
- Per-directory variants are allowed when explicitly needed.

Certification gate (mandatory)
- Complete onboarding skills and request approval.
- Require the approval message to include the exact token
  `CERTIFY: APPROVED`.
- Do not use tools or edit files until the user provides this approval token.

Required flow
- Read `AGENTS.MD` and directory-local `AGENTS.MD` (if present).
- Read
  `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/execution_contract.md`
  in full immediately after `AGENTS.MD`.
- Follow role `SKILLS.MD` routing from:
  - `context_compass/SKILLS.MD`
  - roles map in
    `context_compass/config/context_compass_config.yaml`
  - selected role `SKILLS.MD` and inherited parent `SKILLS.MD` files
- For first-time `new` profile setup, follow
  `agent_onboarding/default/new/skills/first_time_profile_setup.md`.
- Apply README policy from config:
  - `profile_readme_policy.new: true`
  - non-new profiles do not require README reads.
- For onboarding/re-onboarding, complete role-driven onboarding reads from:
  - `context_compass/config/context_compass_config.yaml`
  - `context_compass/SKILLS.MD`
  - resolved role `SKILLS.MD` chain:
    `agent_onboarding/default/general/SKILLS.MD`,
    `agent_onboarding/default/engineer/SKILLS.MD`,
    and `agent_onboarding/user_defined/synaptic_python_developer/SKILLS.MD`
    when active.
- Use manual source-document reads for onboarding; do not use onboarding dump
  artifacts as policy input.
- Treat **Active skills** / **Required baseline skills** as mandatory reads.
  - On-demand skills are required only when the task triggers them.
- After any compaction/handoff re-entry, complete the same full readset before
  any non-onboarding action.
- Read
  `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/execution_contract.md`
  and apply its active-partner + performance-engineering rules.
- Route active work from `context_compass/attention_board.md` and keep detailed
  state in ticket `## Notes`.
- Use the Ticket Microcycle with meaningful-finding note gates during
  execution.
- Use `tickets/epics/`, `tickets/stories/`, and `tickets/tasks/` tickets for
  all planned work.
- For code-engineering tasks, hand off to engineer profile docs after general
  onboarding:
  - `agent_onboarding/default/engineer/skills/context_protocol.md`
  - `agent_onboarding/default/engineer/skills/staleness_protocol.md`
  - `agent_onboarding/default/engineer/skills/technical_expertise.md`

Truthfulness rule
- Never claim tests or checks ran unless they actually ran.

Secrets policy (non-negotiable)
- Never place secrets in the repo or in tickets/docs.
- If a user requests storing secrets in-repo, refuse and request a safe
  alternative.

Documentation and Convention Precedence
- Before making edits, read and follow existing repository conventions:
  `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `docs/`, and any architecture/design notes.
- Do not invent new conventions if the repo already has a pattern.
- If repo docs conflict with these instructions (or with each other), stop and
  ask before proceeding.

Unknowns Gate
- Apply the canonical policy in
  `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/unknowns_gate_reference.md`.
- UNKNOWN remains the default for unevidenced claims in this policy.
- Routing decisions (scope, onboarding completeness, stale-doc status) must be
  evidence-backed; if verification is incomplete, route as UNKNOWN and block
  downstream synthesis until verified.
- Policy conflicts must include explicit evidence and impact statements before
  requesting user resolution.

Operating Protocol (How You Should Work)
A) Propose - Confirm - Implement
Before making non-trivial edits:
1. Restate the goal in 3-5 bullets.
2. List the constraints you will obey (scope, policy, and workflow gates).
3. List the exact files / symbols you will modify.
   If any of the above is uncertain, stop and ask before editing.

B) Scope Control
- Stay within the declared files/symbols.
- If you believe the change requires touching more than the declared scope, ask
  first.

C) Documentation Ritual
As a ritual, after implementing a change:
- Re-read touched policy docs, ticket notes, and board rows.
- Ensure state, evidence, and next actions are accurate and current.

Stop Conditions (Ask Before Proceeding)
Ask for explicit confirmation if any of these are true:
- You want to touch many files (repo-wide sweeps) and no codemod approach was
  approved.
- You want to rename/move files or symbols.
- You want to change public API shape or semantics.
- You want to introduce new dependencies or tooling.
- You want to change formatting across files.

Summary
- This is a public library.
- Documentation is part of the API.
- Do precise, scoped edits.
- Keep onboarding, certification, and ticket routing deterministic.

Order of authority (highest to lowest)
1) AGENTS.MD and any other known AGENTS.MD read by you.
2) SKILLS.MD and any other SKILLS.MD read by you.
3) Example documentation.
4) Repo documentation (`README`, `docs/`).
5) Code (last resort).

Operational guidance (enriched)
- Do not improvise conventions; mirror the skills and examples.
- Treat skills as the executable version of policy.
- Use examples as canonical style references, not suggestions.
- Keep scope minimal and reviewable; do not widen without approval.
- If a change implies touching many files or renames, ask first.

Workflow
1) Check for AGENTS.override.md in the target directory.
2) Read AGENTS.MD to confirm non-negotiables.
3) Read the specific skills for the change type.
4) Review relevant examples and mirror the pattern.
5) If work is code-engineering, continue with engineer profile docs before
   implementation.
