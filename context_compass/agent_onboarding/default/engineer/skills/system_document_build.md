# system_document_build

Purpose
- Define the authoring format for `src_components.md` and `src_architecture.md`.
- Define how their indexes are built and kept current.

## These documents are AUTHORED, not generated

There is no build step and no codegen. `src_components.md` is the file you edit
directly. Nothing assembles it from pieces, and no script writes its prose.

That is not a convenience choice, it is a limit. A component's responsibilities,
its ownership boundaries, and why it exists cannot be derived from source. The
same wall that makes `owns_lifecycle_of` and `borrows` indistinguishable to a
parser makes "this component admits transactions into scope" underivable. If a
tool could write it, it would not be worth reading.

The only generated artifact is the **index**: a table of line ranges that lets a
reader slice the document instead of loading all of it.

| document | authored | generated |
|---|---|---|
| `src_components.md` | the document | `src_components_index.md` |
| `src_architecture.md` | the document | `src_architecture_index.md` |
| `src_graph.md` | nothing | the whole thing - see `src_graph_generation.md` |

## Why format matters

The index is only as useful as the document's heading structure, because
headings are the only thing it can cut on. This is about **addressability**, not
size: a section that cannot be named cannot be requested, however short it is.

**Every navigable unit needs its own heading at a predictable level.** If four
components share one heading, the index cannot offer them separately and a
reader wanting one must read all four.

**Names are the query.** `--slice` matches on the section name, so a section
called `Overview` in a document holding six overviews is unaddressable even
though it is indexed. Name sections after the thing they describe.

**Avoid container headings that hold nothing but other headings.** Indexing a
production `src_components.md` - not the starter shipped here - produces a
`C3 Components Catalog` section of **1,945 lines**: it wraps 24 components, so
its range spans all of them. An entry like that defeats the index while
appearing to use it, because a reader who selects it loads 37% of the document
believing they sliced it. Containers are fine as organisation; just never select
one when a child would do.

The same trap one level up is the document title, which is why the indexer omits
a lone `#` heading entirely.

## Heading shape: `src_components.md` and `tests_components.md`

**This skill does not declare which sections a document contains, or which
fields a component entry carries.** Those are the Required Section Contract and
the Component Entry Contract, and they live in the four `*_instructions.md`
skills. This skill covers only the heading structure the indexer depends on -
restating the section list here would create a second authority, and two lists
drift the moment one is edited.

```markdown
# <document title>                   <- exactly one H1

## <front matter sections>           <- H2, per the Required Section Contract

## C3 Components Catalog             <- H2: container. Never the read target.

### Component: <Name>                <- H3: THE navigable unit. One per component.
- <fields, per the Component Entry Contract>

## C2 Subcomponents Catalog

### Subcomponent: <Name>             <- H3, same shape
```

Rules that the index depends on:

- **Exactly one H1.** More than one and the indexer cannot identify the title,
  so it stops omitting it and you get a section spanning the whole file.
- **Every component is an H3**, never H2 and never H4. Mixed depth means mixed
  granularity in the index.
- **`Component: ` / `Subcomponent: ` prefixes are load-bearing.** They are how a
  reader greps the index for units rather than front matter.
- **Names are unique and stable.** The index is selected on name; two components
  with the same name are indistinguishable to a consumer.
- **`Key Files (C1)` lists real `src/...` paths.** This is the join to
  `src_graph.md`, and it measured 98% resolvable on the reference project. Break
  it and component-to-graph navigation stops working.

## Heading shape: `src_architecture.md` and `tests_architecture.md`

Same rules, one difference: the navigable unit is an **H2 concern**, not an H3
component, because architecture sections cut across components rather than
describing one each. These documents have no container heading at all - every H2
is selectable.

```markdown
# <document title>                   <- exactly one H1

## <Concern>                          <- H2: the navigable unit
### <Sub-topic>                       <- H3: optional, indexed too
```

The source-side and test-side documents at each level are mirrors: same section
contract, same heading shape, same index shape. If a test document's structure
diverges from its source counterpart, the divergence is the defect.

Every system document gets an index. There is no size below which one is
skipped: the index is not a size optimisation, it is how a document becomes
addressable. A small document with an index can be sliced by name; a small
document without one can only be read whole.

Section lists and entry fields:
- `agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/src_components_instructions.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/tests_components_instructions.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/src_architecture_instructions.md`
- `agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/tests_architecture_instructions.md`

## Patch documents: explicit ENTRY markers

Patch documents under `system_docs/patches/` do not section cleanly by heading.
Each entry is a distinct revision of a named thing, and heading depth carries no
meaning there - two revisions of the same component are peers regardless of how
deep their headings happen to sit.

So patches declare their boundaries instead of implying them:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN ENTRY: "AethericMediator: scope acquisition" -->
## Revision 1

Introduces `AethericMediator` as the single admission point for transaction
scope. Callers stop touching `TransactionMediator` directly.

- affects: `src/melder/aether/aetheric_frame/dev_ops/`
- risk: high, changes an admission gate
<!-- END ENTRY: "AethericMediator: scope acquisition" -->
```

**The name in the marker is the point.** It moves verbatim into the index, so a
row identifies the object it covers:

```
| lines | lvl | name |
| 6-14  | 1   | AethericMediator: scope acquisition |
| 16-23 | 1   | ConduitWard: contract delegation |
```

A row keyed by a number tells a reader nothing about whether to read it. Every
index this system produces is keyed by a name - breadcrumb path for authored
documents, source path for the graph, entry name for patches. There are no
anonymous rows anywhere, and there must not be.

Rules:

- `BEGIN ENTRY` and `END ENTRY` are HTML comments, so they do not render.
- Quotes around the name are optional; the name is trimmed either way.
- `END ENTRY` may repeat the name or omit it. If it repeats it, it must match.
- Entries do not nest. Opening one while another is open is an error.
- **Malformed markers refuse to index.** Unbalanced or mismatched markers are
  reported and nothing is written. A silently repaired boundary produces a range
  that looks correct and covers the wrong text.

Markers work in any document. `--mode auto` (the default) uses them when
present and falls back to headings when not, so a document that adopts markers
gets entry-based sectioning with no flag change.

## Building the index

```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_components.md

python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md

python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/architecture_patch.md
```

`--max-level` sets the deepest heading indexed (default 3). `--mode` forces
`heading` or `entry` sectioning. `--check` verifies the existing index is
current and writes nothing - run it before trusting any range.

The tool **never modifies the document**. It reads, validates, and writes
`<stem>_index.md` beside it.

Every range is validated against its own heading before anything is written. An
off-by-one silently corrupts every downstream read, so it is checked rather than
trusted, and a failed validation writes nothing.

## Slicing: how the index is consumed

An index exists to be sliced. The workflow is three steps, and step two is not
optional:

1. Find the section by NAME in the index.
2. Verify the index is current.
3. Read only those lines.

The tool does all three:

```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_components.md \
    --slice "Conduit Runtime"
```

It verifies `line_count` and `content_sha256` against the index ON DISK before
returning anything, and prints the range as a header so the output carries its
own citation:

```
<!-- src_components.md:1319-1403  C3 Components Catalog > Component: Conduit Runtime -->
### Component: Conduit Runtime (Normal and Lesser)
...
```

Behaviour that matters:

- **A stale index refuses to slice.** Edit the document without regenerating and
  you get `INDEX STALE - refusing to slice`, not wrong content.
- **An ambiguous name lists the candidates rather than guessing.** Asking for
  `Catalog` against the reference document matches 88 sections; it prints them
  with their ranges so you can narrow.
- **A missing index refuses too.** Generate before you slice.

This is why section names must be unique and descriptive. `--slice` matches on
the name, so the name is the query - a section called `Overview` in a document
with six overviews is unaddressable.

## Regenerate whenever the document changes

The index records `line_count`, `content_sha256`, and `line_ending`. Insert one
line near the top and every range below it is wrong - while the index still
parses, still looks plausible, and still returns content. It returns the WRONG
content, confidently.

So: edit the document, regenerate the index, in the same pass. A consumer that
finds a mismatch must refuse to slice; see
`agent_onboarding/default/engineer/skills/src_graph_usage.md` for the
verification procedure, which is identical.

## Anti-patterns

- Generating any part of these documents. They are authored.
- Hand-editing an index. Regenerate it.
- Editing the document and leaving the index stale.
- Selecting a container section (`C3 Components Catalog`) when a component
  section would answer the question.
- Adding a second H1, or nesting components at inconsistent depths.
- Renaming a component without checking who cited it.
- Omitting `Key Files (C1):`, which silently severs the join to `src_graph.md`.
- Restating a section list or entry contract here. This skill owns heading shape
  and index mechanics; the `*_instructions.md` skills own what goes in them.
