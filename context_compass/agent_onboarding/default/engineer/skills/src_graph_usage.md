# src_graph_usage

Purpose
- Define how to READ the assembled source graph without loading all of it.

## What the graph is

Two files under `system_docs/`:

- `src_graph.md` - one section per source file, each delimited by an HTML
  comment naming that file.
- `src_graph_index.md` - the exact line range of every section, plus a
  staleness proof.

Both are generated. Never hand-edit either one; see
`agent_onboarding/default/engineer/skills/src_graph_generation.md`.

## The read order (non-negotiable)

1. Read `src_graph_index.md`. It is small - about 3% of the document's lines,
   6% of its bytes.
2. **Verify it is current** (next section).
3. Find the row for the source file you care about.
4. Read only that line range out of `src_graph.md`.

Do not read `src_graph.md` in full. On the reference codebase it is 20,261
lines against a 602-line index; a single file's section is typically 20-40
lines. Reading the whole document to answer a question about one file costs
roughly 500x what the answer needs.

Do not scan the document for `BEGIN FILE` markers instead of using the index.
The index is authoritative, it was emitted by the same pass that wrote the
document, and scanning defeats the entire point of having ranges.

## Verify before you slice

The index records what the document was when it was generated:

| field | how to verify |
|---|---|
| `line_count` | recount the document's lines |
| `content_sha256` | rehash the document's exact bytes |
| `line_ending` | split on THAT terminator, always `lf` here |

On any mismatch the document was hand-edited or the pipeline was interrupted.
**STOP. Do not slice.** Regenerate, or read the file directly and say which you
did. A range from an unverified index is a guess wearing a line number.

```python
import hashlib, pathlib, re

doc = pathlib.Path("context_compass/system_docs/src_graph.md")
idx = pathlib.Path("context_compass/system_docs/src_graph_index.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")

raw = doc.read_bytes()
claimed_lines = int(re.search(r"line_count \| (\d+)", idx).group(1))
claimed_hash = re.search(r"content_sha256 \| `([0-9a-f]{64})`", idx).group(1)

lines = raw.decode("utf-8").split("\n")
if lines and lines[-1] == "":
    lines.pop()

if len(lines) != claimed_lines or hashlib.sha256(raw).hexdigest() != claimed_hash:
    raise SystemExit("INDEX STALE - refusing to slice; regenerate the graph")
```

## Selecting what to read

Each index row is `| lines | source | nodes | edges |`. The `edges` count covers
both derived and authored edges, matching what that section's `Edges out` table
renders. Edge candidates are not counted - they are guesses, not edges.

- **Working one file**: match `source` against its path, read that range.
- **Working a subsystem**: match `source` against the directory prefix and read
  each matching range. Rows are ordered by source path, so a subsystem's files
  are contiguous.
- **Following a relationship**: a section's `Edges out` table gives fully
  qualified target ids. Map the id back to a path and look that row up.
- **Finding what points AT something**: the per-file sections carry outbound
  edges only. Inbound edges are not answerable from one section - you must
  either scan the index-selected sections you care about, or accept that
  reverse lookup is the one query this layout does not make cheap.

## What each section contains

- `source_sha256` of the source file at generation time. If you are reasoning
  about current code, check it against the file on disk.
- **Nodes**: id, kind (`module`, `class`, `interface`, `abstract`, `enum`,
  `record`), definition line, bases, markers, public methods, and the authored
  fields (`role`, `responsibilities`, `owns_state`, `phases`) when present.
- **Edges out**: `specializes` and `implements`, with resolved target ids.
- **Edge candidates**: AST instantiation guesses. **Unconfirmed.** These
  over-generate roughly 8x against a hand-authored graph. Treat them as leads,
  never as evidence.
- **Published aliases**: module-level `Alias = Class` bindings, which are the
  names consumers actually import.

## Trust boundaries

Read every section with this in mind:

- Node identity, `bases`, and `specializes` are **mechanical** - derived from
  the syntax tree, measured at 94-98% agreement with a hand-authored graph.
- `role`, `responsibilities`, `owns_state`, `phases`, and any edge marked
  `authored` are **authored** by an agent or human who read the code.
- A node marked **UNSEMANTIC** has scaffold only. Its structure is trustworthy;
  its meaning has not been established. Do not infer purpose from a name.
- Edge candidates are **guesses**.

Cite what you read with `path:start_line-end_line` against `src_graph.md`, the
same evidence convention used everywhere else in this repository.

## Anti-patterns

- Reading `src_graph.md` in full when the index would answer the question.
- Slicing without verifying `line_count` and `content_sha256` first.
- Treating an edge candidate as a real relationship.
- Treating an UNSEMANTIC node's name as a description of its purpose.
- Quoting a `source_sha256` as proof the code is current without comparing it
  to the file on disk.
