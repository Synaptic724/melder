# Engineer Example: Task Execution Flow

Context
- The user asks for a small refactor with tests.
- Follow `agent_onboarding/default/general/skills/workflow.md` and
  `SKILLS.MD` for ticketing and execution rules.

Example flow (concise)
1) Confirm scope and list files to be changed.
2) Read the relevant module and docstrings.
3) Propose a minimal plan (2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“4 steps) and confirm.
4) Implement the change with docstrings and tests.
5) Run `pytest` and report results or say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNot run.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â

Expected output format (sample)
- Plan:
  - Update `module_x.py` to split helper function.
  - Add unit test for the new behavior.
  - Run `pytest -q`.
- Changes:
  - `module_x.py`: refactored helper, updated docstrings.
  - `tests/unit/test_module_x.py`: new coverage for split helper.
- Tests:
  - `pytest -q` (pass)
