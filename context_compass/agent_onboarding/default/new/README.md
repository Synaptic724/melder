# Default Profile: new

Purpose
- First-time onboarding profile.
- Minimal path to onboard a developer before selecting a steady-state profile.

Rules
- Keep this profile lightweight and orientation-focused.
- Do not place deep language-specific execution rules here.
- On completion, route to `general` or `engineer` by config.
- Keep this profile user-facing: explain system purpose, classes, and config.

Folder structure
- `skills/`: first-time onboarding skills.
- `policies/`: onboarding policy and completion rules.
- `behavioral_guidelines/`: user-onboarding behavior flow.
- `examples/`: reserved for first-time onboarding examples.

First-time setup focus
- Use this profile to select a steady-state default profile.
- `general`: shared system/policy/ticketing baseline.
- `engineer`: programming/testing specialization layered on `general`.
- `synaptic_python_developer`: user-defined overlay layered on `engineer`.

Agent-read policy
- README reads are allowed for `new` first-time onboarding.
- Non-new profile execution should use map/policy docs, not README files.
