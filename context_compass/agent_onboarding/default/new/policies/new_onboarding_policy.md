# new_onboarding_policy

Purpose
- Define the mandatory policy for `new` first-time onboarding.
- Keep this profile user-facing and orientation-heavy, not implementation-heavy.

Scope
- Applies only when routing through `agent_onboarding/default/new/SKILLS.MD`.
- Ends when the user chooses and applies a default steady-state class/profile.

Policy
- Explain the system in plain language before asking for configuration changes.
- Describe the system goal accurately:
  - context_compass is a code-development workflow system,
  - it supports any programming language,
  - it improves consistency when using Codex and other AI agents.
- State current execution recommendation explicitly:
  - use Codex with Extra High reasoning,
  - other reasoning modes are not yet validated in this repository.
- Explain profile classes and inheritance before asking for selection.
- Make `engineer` the recommended default class after onboarding.
- Keep `new` profile content minimal; do not load deep engineering policy here.

Configuration authority
- `config/context_compass_config.yaml` is the source of truth for:
  - active profile selection,
  - available profile classes,
  - onboarding defaults and transitions.
- `agent_onboarding/*/SKILLS.MD` headers are the source of truth for:
  - inheritance chain,
  - resolved parent-first read order.

Completion criteria
- User understands what the system is for.
- User understands profiles/classes and inheritance.
- User understands where config lives and how to change it.
- User is offered default class selection with `engineer` recommended.
- Next step is clear and explicit before leaving `new`.
