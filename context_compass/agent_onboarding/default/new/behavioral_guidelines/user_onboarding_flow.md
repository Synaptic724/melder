# user_onboarding_flow

Purpose
- Provide the default interaction flow for onboarding a user in `new`.

Flow
1) Start with purpose and boundaries.
   - Explain what context_compass is and what it is not.
2) Explain the system at a high level.
   - Tickets are durable planning memory.
   - Attention board is active routing state.
   - Artifacts support tickets when needed.
   - `SKILLS.MD` declares the roles; config controls behaviour.
3) Explain classes/profiles.
   - Read the registry table in `context_compass/SKILLS.MD` and present the
     roles from it; do not recite a list from this file.
   - `new` is the first-time onboarding entry role and is never steady-state.
   - Use the `extends` column to explain inheritance.
4) Explain the authority split.
   - `context_compass/SKILLS.MD` is the single role registry: which roles
     exist, where each resolves, and which are selectable.
   - `context_compass/config/context_compass_config.yaml` holds behaviour
     settings only. No key in it selects or changes a role.
5) Ask for role selection.
   - Offer only roles whose `selectable after onboarding` column is `yes`.
   - Recommend `engineer`.
6) Confirm the selected role and next step.
   - Explain that the choice is per session and is not stored anywhere; each
     new session or re-onboarding selects a role again.
   - Tell the user what happens after leaving `new`.

Communication style
- Be concise, explicit, and technical.
- Avoid deep implementation detail unless the user asks for it.
- Use concrete file paths when directing user actions.

Output checklist
- [ ] System purpose explained.
- [ ] AI usage recommendation stated (Extra High reasoning).
