# src_architecture_instructions

## Purpose
- Define the exact build protocol for
  `context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md`.
- Produce a durable C4 architecture document that is re-entry safe after
  compaction.

## Canonical Output
- `context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md`

## Example Documents (Required Read)
- `context_compass/examples/example_architecture/src_architecture.md`
- `context_compass/examples/example_architecture/tests_architecture.md`
- `context_compass/examples/example_components/src_components.md`
- `context_compass/examples/example_components/tests_components.md`

The canonical output does not ship with the package. `system_docs/` is empty in
a fresh install, so on first run you are creating this document, not editing
one. The examples above are the shape reference; this repository is the source
of truth for the content.

## Required Inputs (Read First)
- `context_compass/system_docs/src_components.md`
- `context_compass/system_docs/src_graph.md`
- `context_compass/system_docs/src_graph_index.md`
- `context_compass/system_docs/tests_architecture.md`
- `context_compass/system_docs/tests_components.md`
- `context_compass/system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/architecture_patch.md`
  (when patch lane is active)
- `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/src_components_instructions.md`
- `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/patch_framework_design.md`
- `context_compass/agent_onboarding/default/design_engineer/skills/architecture_patch_contracts.md`
- Active ticket and `context_compass/attention_board.md` route

## Indexing Contract (Non-Negotiable)

This document is AUTHORED. Nothing generates its prose. The only generated
artifact is its index, and the index is only as useful as the heading structure
you give it.

Regenerate the index in the SAME pass that edits the document:

```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md
```

Heading discipline the index depends on:
- **Exactly one H1.** A second one and the indexer cannot identify the document
  title, so it stops omitting it and emits a section spanning the whole file.
- **The navigable unit is H2 `## <Concern>`.** Consistent depth, never mixed.
- **Names unique and stable.** Index rows are selected on name; two sections
  sharing a name are indistinguishable to a consumer.
- **No container headings in this document.** Every H2 is a selectable concern,
  so there is no wrapper heading to select by mistake. Keep it that way: the
  moment an H2 exists only to group other headings, it indexes as a range
  covering all of them, and a reader selecting it loads that whole span
  believing they sliced one section. On a production `src_components.md` that
  mistake costs 37% of the document in a single slice.

Consume the index by slicing, never by reading the document whole:

```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md --slice "<section name>"
```

It verifies the index before returning anything, refuses on a stale index, and
lists candidates rather than guessing when a name is ambiguous. Section names
are therefore the query - keep them unique and descriptive.

Verify before trusting any range:

```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/index_document.py \
    --doc context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md --check
```

An index records `line_count`, `content_sha256`, and `line_ending`. Insert one
line near the top and every range below it is wrong while still parsing and
still returning content - the WRONG content, confidently. On mismatch: STOP,
regenerate, do not eyeball an offset.

## Unknowns Gate (Non-Negotiable)
- New claims start as `UNKNOWN`.
- Promote to `FACT` only with direct evidence.
- Evidence must be concrete code/doc references, not naming inference.

## Required Section Contract
`src_architecture.md` must contain these sections in order:
1. `## Metadata`
2. `## Scope and Intent`
3. `## Indexing`
4. `## DO NOT ASSUME / Unknowns Gate`
5. `## Unknowns`
6. `## System Context (C4)`
7. `## System Boundary and External Interfaces`
8. `## Architecture Summary (C4)`
9. `## Entrypoints and Runtime Guardrails`
10. `## Boot and Configuration Sequence`
11. `## Data Flows and Sequences`
12. `## Operational Invariants`
13. `## Failure Modes and Error Paths`
14. `## C1 Code Map (Core Only)`
15. `## Diagrams`
16. `## Information Sources`
17. `## Context / Handoff Summary`

### Sections not in the contract

The contract is a **minimum in a fixed relative order**, not a whitelist. Other
sections are permitted and are common: real documents run 44 H2 sections against
a 17-section contract. Read literally as "only these sections", a recomposition
deletes roughly 1,200 lines per document.

If material genuinely does not belong here, it is **moved, never deleted**:

- relocate it to a named target - the patch lane
  (`system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/`) is the conventional destination
- name that target in `## Context / Handoff Summary`
- state plainly that until it is re-absorbed it lives in neither canonical
  document

"Delete it because the contract does not list it" is never the right answer.

## C1 Code Map Contract
Every C1 entry must include:
- `path`
- `start_line`
- `end_line`
- `loc`
- `verified_at` (UTC DateTime `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)

**Directories are not valid C1 entries.** A directory has no line range, and the
join to `src_graph.md` is keyed by source file, so a directory citation can never
resolve. Expand it into its constituent non-`__init__` modules and measure each.
Do not write `UNKNOWN` for a directory: `UNKNOWN` means "not yet verified and
here is the investigation target", and a directory is unverifiable in principle -
the marker would sit there forever with nothing to resolve it.

Ranges are measured, never estimated. If the exact range is not verified, keep
the claim `UNKNOWN` and add an investigation target in `## Unknowns` rather than
writing a plausible number.

## Diagram Contract
- Include one ASCII architecture diagram.
- Include one Mermaid architecture diagram.
- Keep labels operational (ownership, flow, boundary), not decorative.
- Keep diagram terms aligned with section terminology.

## Build Sequence (Top-Down, Required)
2a. Unwrap any heading spanning more than one physical line. A reflowed
    heading parses as several sections; the first wins "narrowest match"
    and `--slice` returns a stub. `index_document.py` warns on unclosed
    brackets, which is the usual tell, but it cannot catch every wrap -
    scan the heading list once before you trust it.

1. Confirm active ticket route and architecture scope.
2. Read required example documents and note formatting patterns to preserve.
3. Re-read companion component/test docs for boundary alignment.
4. Draft/refresh `Metadata`, `Scope and Intent`, and Unknowns sections.
5. Define system boundary, interfaces, and high-level runtime summary.
6. Write entrypoints and boot/configuration sequence.
7. Write data-flow sequences (normal path and failure path).
8. Capture invariants and failure modes with source evidence.
9. Build C1 core map with line ranges, LOC, and verification timestamps.
10. Refresh diagrams to match narrative and naming.
11. If patch lane is active, verify architecture patch updates are complete and
    linked in tickets.
12. Refresh `Information Sources` and `Context / Handoff Summary`.

Do not skip sequence order. If blocked, write a `BLOCKER` note in the active
ticket before expanding scope.

## Content Preservation Gate (Non-Negotiable)

**Structural checks cannot see content loss.** Every check in the Quality Gate
below is structural - sections present, fields present, ranges present. A
recomposition can pass all of them while having silently destroyed text.

This is not hypothetical. A real recomposition of a 2,249-line architecture
document lost ~170 lines to a regex that captured only the description text on
the same physical line as the path: fifteen wrapped descriptions truncated, two
destroyed outright, and a previous `## Context / Handoff Summary` overwritten,
taking a record of decisions in force with it. All six structural checks passed
the entire time. It was caught by a human noticing the file had shrunk.

So, before the first transform:

1. Capture a **multiset** of the document's non-blank, whitespace-normalised
   lines. Counts, not a set - a set cannot see that a line appearing three times
   now appears once.
2. Do the work.
3. Re-capture and compare. Every line from the baseline must appear either in
   the resulting document or in a **named migration target** you can point at.

```bash
# before
grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$' DOC.md | sed 's/[[:space:]]\+/ /g' | sort | uniq -c > /tmp/before.txt
# after
grep -v '^[[:space:]]*$' DOC.md | sed 's/[[:space:]]\+/ /g' | sort | uniq -c > /tmp/after.txt
diff /tmp/before.txt /tmp/after.txt
```

**The baseline must be captured BEFORE the first edit.** Captured afterwards it
proves nothing - it describes the document you already built, which is the exact
trap that makes "I verified it" feel true while content is gone.

A line legitimately removed is fine. A line you cannot account for is a defect,
and this gate fails until you can name where it went.

## Quality Gate (Pass/Fail)
Pass only when all checks are true:
- [ ] Content Preservation Gate satisfied: every baseline line is present
      in this document or in a named migration target.
- [ ] Required section order exists and is complete.
- [ ] Unknowns are explicit and carry investigation targets.
- [ ] Boundary/interfaces and boot sequence are concrete and testable.
- [ ] C1 entries include path, range, LOC, and verified_at.
- [ ] Diagrams match written flow and use aligned terminology.
- [ ] Information Sources cover every promoted FACT.

## Validation Commands
- `rg -n '^#{1,6} .*[([][^)\]]*$' context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md` - headings with an unclosed bracket, the usual sign of a wrap
- `rg -n "^## " context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md`
- `rg -n "UNKNOWN|C1 Code Map|Information Sources|Context / Handoff Summary" context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md`
- `rg -n "path|start_line|end_line|loc|verified_at" context_compass/system_docs/src_architecture.md`

## Staleness Triggers (When Update Is Mandatory)
- Boundary or integration contracts changed.
- Boot/configuration ordering changed.
- Invariants/failure modes changed.
- C1 line ranges became stale from code edits.
- `src_components.md` introduces term/boundary changes.
- `src_graph.md` changed because documented source wiring or
  ownership relationships changed.
- `src_graph_index.md` changed because canonical object relationships or ownership
  moved.
- Active `architecture_patch.md` changed for the same patch id.

## Anti-Patterns (Reject)
- Placeholder claims without evidence.
- C1 map entries without ranges/LOC/verified_at.
- Diagrams that do not match section content.
- Mixing component-level deep dives into architecture sections.

## Handoff Rule
- End with a concise `Context / Handoff Summary` that states:
  - what changed,
  - what remains unknown,
  - where the next reader should start.
