Purpose
- Maintain C4/C3/C2/C1 architecture and component context for this repo.

Artifacts
- `system_docs/src_architecture.md`
- `system_docs/tests_architecture.md`
- `system_docs/src_components.md`
- `system_docs/tests_components.md`
- `system_docs/graph_details_document.md`
- `system_docs/readable_src_graph.json`
- `system_docs/src_graph.json`
- `system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/architecture_patch.md` (when patch lane is active)
- `system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/component_patch_<component>.md` (when patch lane is active)
- `system_docs/patches/active/<patch_id>/code_description_patch_<component>.md` (conditional)

Strict source rule
- Architecture and component docs must reflect the actual codebase and ticket context.
- If docs are stale, update them before relying on them for design decisions.

Update cadence
- Update docs when boundaries, lifecycle, invariants, or wiring change.
- Keep `readable_src_graph.json` synchronized with canonical graph state when
  architecture/components work changes source wiring coverage.
- Keep ASCII and Mermaid diagrams current.
- Keep active patch docs synchronized with canonical docs until merge+cleanup closes the patch lane.
