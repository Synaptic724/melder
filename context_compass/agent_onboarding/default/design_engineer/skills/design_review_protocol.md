# design_review_protocol

Purpose
- Define how designs are reviewed, validated, and approved before implementation.
- Ensure the handoff is deterministic and non-performative.

Review checkpoints (recommended)
1) Problem framing checkpoint
   - verify goal/non-goals, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
2) Architecture checkpoint
   - verify boundaries, interfaces, data model, and tradeoffs.
3) Operational checkpoint
   - verify rollout, observability, failure handling, and test strategy.
4) Implementation readiness checkpoint
   - verify tickets are actionable and scoped.

Review artifacts
- For any checkpoint, provide:
  - a concise summary,
  - explicit open questions,
  - explicit decision points requiring approval.

Rules
- Do not start implementation unless a checkpoint is explicitly approved when:
  - design changes public contracts, schemas, or major boundaries,
  - the user requested "design only" first,
  - risk is high or rollback is complex.
