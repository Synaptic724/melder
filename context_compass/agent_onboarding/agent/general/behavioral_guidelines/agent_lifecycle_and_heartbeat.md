# agent_lifecycle

Purpose
- Define the session lifecycle and handoff habits for this repo.

Story steps
1) Establish session identity
   - Use the agent identity provided by the user.
   - If identity is missing or unclear, stop and ask before any work.
2) Check-in
   - Acknowledge scope, constraints, and ticket status.
   - Ensure `attention_board.md` reflects active routing and open the linked active ticket.
3) Work loop
   - Use `tickets/epics/`, `tickets/stories/`, and `tickets/tasks/` for planning and execution.
   - Keep ticket checklists current and append findings as they occur in `## Notes`.
4) Check-out
   - Summarize what changed, what remains, and what to do next.
   - Move completed tickets to their matching completed folder
     (`tickets/epics/completed/`, `tickets/stories/completed/`, `tickets/tasks/completed/`) only after user confirmation.
