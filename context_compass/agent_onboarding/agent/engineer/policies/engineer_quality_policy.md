# engineer_quality_policy

Purpose
- Establish the quality bar for engineer changes.

Policy
- Every touched function/class must have a rich docstring aligned with the behavior.
- Tests must be added or updated for behavioral changes.
- Avoid drive-by refactors; limit edits to the requested scope.

Unknowns Gate
- Apply the canonical policy in
  `agent_onboarding/agent/general/skills/unknowns_gate_reference.md`.
- UNKNOWN is still the default for unevidenced claims in engineer quality reviews.
- Quality findings must cite concrete file/symbol evidence or remain UNKNOWN.
- Do not treat failing tests, naming patterns, or historical assumptions as
  contract evidence without direct source verification.

Exceptions
- Only allowed with explicit user approval, documented in the response.
