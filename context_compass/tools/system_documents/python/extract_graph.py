"""Scaffold per-source-file graph descriptors for a Python codebase.

This is the MECHANICAL half of the system-documents graph. It walks a source
tree, parses each file with the stdlib `ast` module, and emits one descriptor
per source file mirroring the source path.

What this script produces is a SKELETON, not the graph. Measured against a
hand-authored graph of 535 nodes / 997 edges:

    node identity        98% recovered   (529 / 535)
    `specializes` edges  98% recovered   (155 / 158)  - inheritance is syntax
    `creates` edges      57% recovered, 8x over-generated - flagged as candidates
    everything else       0% recoverable - 68% of all edges

`owns_lifecycle_of`, `uses`, and `borrows` are syntactically IDENTICAL - each is
"A holds a reference to B". Which one it is, is a design fact that does not
exist in the source text. Likewise every `role`, `responsibility`, `why`,
`cardinality`, and `strength`. Those are authored, and this script must never
overwrite them.

Hence the merge contract: on re-run, mechanical fields are refreshed and
authored fields are preserved untouched. The script reports drift (nodes that
appeared, disappeared, or still lack semantics) rather than silently resolving
it.

Language-agnostic by layout: this lives under `tools/system_documents/python/`
so a sibling `tools/system_documents/<language>/` can implement the same
descriptor contract for another language.

Usage:
    python extract_graph.py --src src --out context_compass/system_docs/graph

    # report drift without writing
    python extract_graph.py --src src --out ... --check

    # fail if any source file could not be parsed (CI / unattended runs)
    python extract_graph.py --src src --out ... --strict

A file this interpreter cannot parse gets no descriptor, so every node in it
leaves the graph silently - the run still succeeds and the document is simply one
section shorter. That is correct when the file is broken and wrong when the file
is merely NEWER than the interpreter. `--strict` turns that into a non-zero exit
so an unattended run cannot publish a graph with holes in it.

    # skip __init__.py (included by default - it usually carries a package's
    # public surface, so dropping it would lose what a package exposes)
    python extract_graph.py --src src --out ... --exclude-init
