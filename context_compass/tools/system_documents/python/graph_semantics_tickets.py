OFF BY DEFAULT, AND IT HAS TO BE

A library that writes tickets into somebody's board without being asked is doing
something hostile. Nothing here runs as part of extraction or assembly; this is a
separate command, dry-run by default, and it asks before writing.

AGGREGATED AT THE PACKAGE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN CONSTRAINT

On a real codebase the census is ~1,188 unsemantic nodes across ~575 files.

    one ticket per node   1,188 tickets   destroys the board
    one ticket per file     575 tickets   destroys the board
    one story per package    ~33 stories  usable

The attention board is a routing surface carrying roughly a dozen active rows.
Any design emitting per-node or per-file work is unusable on the first real
repository it meets. A package is also the unit an agent actually works in - a
subsystem at a time - so it is the natural granularity as well as the survivable
one.

    1 epic       "Author graph semantics"        the backlog as a whole
      N stories  one per package needing work    only where there is work

**Tasks are deliberately not generated.** Task granularity is the working
agent's judgement, and pre-generating it presumes an approach to work nobody has
started yet.

IDEMPOTENCY IS NOT OPTIONAL

Ticket ids derive from the package path, so re-running updates rather than
duplicates. A scan that doubles the board every run gets switched off within a
day and never switched back on. Equally, a package whose semantics get authored
has its story reported as SATISFIED rather than left open forever - the loop has
to close in both directions or it is just a different kind of noise.

# Story: Author graph semantics for `{package}`

## Metadata
- Story ID: {story_id}
- Epic: {epic_id}
- Status: draft
- Owner:
- Agent Name:
- Priority: p2
- Created: {stamp()}
- Updated: {stamp()}

## User Narrative
As an agent reading the source graph, I want `{package}` to carry authored
semantics, so that I can tell what its objects are FOR without re-deriving it
from the code every time.

## Value / MRP Alignment
The mechanical tier already says what exists. Without the authored tier the graph
cannot say what anything means, and every reader pays the same rediscovery cost.

## Ticket Contract
- ENTRY_GATE: active board row exists and the graph is current (`extract_graph.py --check`).
- EXECUTION_BOUNDARY: descriptors under `{package}` only. Do not author neighbouring packages.
- DEPENDENCIES: {epic_id}
- EXIT_GATE: every node below carries `role` and `responsibilities`; `graph_walker.py --report` shows 0 unsemantic and 0 stale for this package; graph reassembled.
- FAILURE_ESCALATION: raise DECISION_REQUEST if a node's purpose cannot be established from source.

## Requirements (Functional)
- Author `role` and `responsibilities` for each node listed below.
- Author `owns_state` and `phases` where the source supports them.
- Author `edges_authored` for relationships this package owns or borrows.

## Requirements (Non-Functional)
- **Semantics must be authored by READING THE CODE.** Never inferred from names.
- `owns_lifecycle_of`, `uses` and `borrows` are syntactically identical - `self._x = x`
  in all three cases. The difference is design intent that appears nowhere in the
  source text. Measured on a labelled corpus, a cleanup-contract heuristic
  discriminated at 21% vs 21% - no signal at all. Invented semantics are worse
  than none, because they read as verified.

## Scope Boundaries
- IN: authored tier for `{package}`.
- OUT: mechanical fields, other packages, refactoring the source.

## State Transition Event
- draft -> ready when an agent claims it on the attention board.

## Dependencies / Related Work
- Epic: {epic_id}

## Tasks (Implementation Checklist)
- [ ] Read the source for each node below.
- [ ] Author the semantic fields in the descriptors.
- [ ] Reassemble the graph and verify ranges.
- [ ] `graph_walker.py --report` shows this package clean.

## Acceptance Criteria
- {total} node(s) below carry authored semantics grounded in the source.
- No node authored from its name alone.

## Validation / Test Plan
```bash
python context_compass/tools/system_documents/python/graph_walker.py \\
    --descriptors <descriptors> --report --by package
```

## Nodes To Author

Unsemantic ({len(unsemantic)}):
{chr(10).join(f"- `{n}`" for n in unsemantic) or "- none"}

Semantics stale ({len(stale)}) - source changed under existing prose, re-verify then
`graph_walker.py --accept <id> --apply`:
{chr(10).join(f"- `{n}`" for n in stale) or "- none"}

## Open Questions
- (none recorded)

## Decision Log
- {stamp()}: generated by `graph_semantics_tickets.py` from the graph census.

## Notes
- Generated. Re-running the scan UPDATES this ticket rather than creating another.
- The `{STORY_MARKER}` id above is what makes that work; do not remove it.

## Context / Handoff Summary
Author the semantic tier for `{package}`. The node list is the scope. Read the
code; do not infer from names.

# Epic: Author graph semantics

## Metadata
- Epic ID: {epic_id}
- Status: draft
- Owner:
- Agent Name:
- Priority: p2
- Created: {stamp()}
- Updated: {stamp()}

## Problem / Opportunity
The source graph's mechanical tier self-heals on every extraction. The authored
tier does not exist until somebody writes it, and until then the graph can say
what exists but not what any of it is for.

## MRP Alignment (Most Reasonable Product)
Authoring semantics per package, in the order the work is actually done, rather
than attempting the whole graph at once.

## Ticket Contract
- ENTRY_GATE: the graph is current.
- EXECUTION_BOUNDARY: descriptors only. No source changes.
- DEPENDENCIES: none.
- EXIT_GATE: every story below closed; `graph_walker.py --report` shows 0 stale.
- FAILURE_ESCALATION: DECISION_REQUEST when a node's purpose is not establishable.

## Goals (Outcomes)
- Every graph node carries authored meaning, or is explicitly recorded as not
  worth authoring.

## Non-Goals (Explicit Exclusions)
- Generating semantics automatically. It was tested against a labelled corpus and
  the most valuable fields are not derivable; see the story requirements.
- Refactoring source to make it more derivable.

## Success Metrics
- `graph_walker.py --report`: UNSEMANTIC and SEMANTICS_STALE both at 0.

## Stories (Required to Complete)
{rows}

Total nodes needing work: {total}

## Notes
- Generated by `graph_semantics_tickets.py`. Re-running updates rather than duplicates.
- The `{STORY_MARKER}` id above is what makes that work; do not remove it.

## Context / Handoff Summary
One story per package with unauthored or stale semantics. Work a subsystem at a
time; the stories are ordered by how much is outstanding.
