"""Reconcile the graph's authored tier against source. Read-only by default.

    graph_walker.py --descriptors <dir> --accept app.mod.Alpha --apply

WHAT THIS ANSWERS

The mechanical tier self-heals: re-run the extractor and classes, bases and line
numbers are correct again. The authored tier does not. It is written once, and
nothing has ever said which parts are still true. Over months that produces a
graph full of confident descriptions of code that no longer works that way, and
no way to tell those from the accurate ones.

FOUR STATES

    UNSEMANTIC        no authored fields. The extractor refusing to guess.
    AUTHORED          authored, and the source has not moved since.
    SEMANTICS_STALE   authored, but its source changed underneath it.
    RETIRED           gone from source; prose retained under `nodes_retired`.

`UNSEMANTIC` is a state, not a defect. A brand new project is entirely
unsemantic and that is correct.

WHY IT IS READ-ONLY

Everything here except `--accept` reports. Deleting authored prose is reserved
for an explicit act, because the failure this subsystem exists to prevent is a
regeneration quietly discarding human work - and a walker that tidies up on its
own would be that failure wearing a different hat.

`--accept` is the one write, and it is narrow: it re-stamps a node whose
semantics you have RE-READ and confirmed. It changes no prose. Accepting without
reading is how a graph becomes confidently wrong, so the stamp records the
source it was accepted against, not the fact that someone ran a command.
