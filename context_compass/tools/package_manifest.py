"""Emit the package manifest: what ships, who owns it, and its hash.

The manifest is the contract both `cleanup_context_compass.py` and
`update_context_compass.py` read. It answers three questions per path:

    does this file belong to the package?   -> presence in the manifest
    who is allowed to change it?            -> the ownership class
    has it changed since it shipped?        -> the sha256

WHY A GENERATED MANIFEST RATHER THAN PER-FILE VERSION STAMPS

A version header inside each document has to be bumped by hand, and nothing
enforces the bump. Miss one and the stamp lies while looking authoritative -
the same failure mode as a stale index. A manifest rebuilt from the files
themselves cannot drift, because it is derived rather than declared.

OWNERSHIP CLASSES

    PACKAGE   ships with the library and is not edited downstream.
              Cleanup restores it. Update replaces it.

    RESET     a lane the package seeds and the consuming project then fills:
              tickets, artifacts, system docs, project instructions.
              Cleanup removes files NOT in the manifest and keeps the ones that
              are. Update never touches the contents.

    INSTANCE  the project's own work, listed so both tools know to leave it
              alone. Two directories: `agent_onboarding/user_defined/` for role
              overlays, and top-level `user_defined/` for anything else. Neither
              tool restores, replaces or removes anything in either, in any mode.
              Listing them explicitly is safer than relying on absence, because a
              file missing from the manifest is indistinguishable from one that
              was never meant to be there.

              These exist so an upgrade never has to choose between the user's
              work and the new version. Package files are conformed; if you need
              something different, it lives here instead.

    LIVE      one file holding a package-owned block plus instance-owned body.
              The boards. Update swaps only the block between MANAGED markers.

    CONFIG    key-level merge, never a whole-file swap. Adding a key must not
              silently reset a value the user set.

Classes are assigned by path prefix, longest match wins, so a PACKAGE directory
can still contain a RESET subtree. That distinction is not theoretical: during
the cleanup that motivated this tool, `tools/` was package-owned and still had
five foreign files sitting in it.
