# Context Compass

Context Compass is a policy-driven context orchestrator for AI-assisted execution.
It gives agents a deterministic way to onboard, route work, preserve context,
and recover cleanly after compaction or session reset.

This repository is built as a public library. You can use it directly, fork it,
or adapt it to your own role stack and process requirements.

## What This Project Is

Context Compass is not a prompt snippet and not a one-shot template.
It is a file-backed coordination system that defines:

- how an agent should read policy,
- how a role is selected and resolved,
- how work must be routed through tickets,
- how evidence is captured while work is in motion,
- and how continuity is preserved across interruptions.

The goal is practical reliability: less agent drift, better state continuity,
and auditable execution quality.

## What It Solves

Most failures in long AI sessions are process failures:

- policy gets partially remembered,
- onboarding claims drift from what was actually read,
- execution starts without durable state,
- and compaction wipes critical context.

Context Compass addresses that by making execution contract-driven:

- onboarding is explicit,
- role resolution is explicit,
- certification is explicit,
- ticket routing is explicit,
- compaction re-entry is explicit.

## Agent Support

This distribution is wired to a single runtime entrypoint: `AGENTS.MD`.

`AGENTS.MD` is a widely adopted convention for repository-level agent
instructions, so most coding-agent runtimes pick it up without configuration. If
yours looks for a different filename, point that file at `AGENTS.MD` rather than
duplicating the policy - two copies of a contract drift, and the drift is silent.

Context Compass is runtime-neutral by design. Nothing in the routing or policy
core depends on which vendor's agent is reading it; the requirements are file
access, shell or tool access, and the ability to follow written instructions.

## Core Design Principles

1. Evidence before assertion.
2. Deterministic gates before execution.
3. Durable state in files, not chat memory.
4. Parent-first role inheritance.
5. Re-onboarding after compaction/handoff.
6. Explicit uncertainty (`UNKNOWN`) over silent guessing.

Five directories are yours and are never written to by an upgrade: `system_docs/`,
`tickets/`, `artifacts/`, `context_management/`, `special_instructions/`, plus
`agent_onboarding/user_defined/`. Everything else belongs to the package and is
replaced when you upgrade. `MANIFEST.md` records which is which, per file.

`system_docs/` ships empty on purpose. A seeded placeholder in a live lane gets
read as repository truth no matter what banner sits on it, so the shape
reference lives in `examples/` instead and this directory stays yours.

## How It Works

### 1) Policy Bootstrap

The agent starts from the runtime entrypoint:

- The agent reads `AGENTS.MD` and resolves directly into the shared policy chain.

### 2) Role Routing

`SKILLS.MD` is the single role registry. Its table declares every role and the
`SKILLS.MD` path each one resolves to. The selected role resolves to a
`SKILLS.MD` chain with parent-first inheritance, walked via the
`INHERITS_SKILLS_FROM` header in each file.

Each role declares:

- required baseline skills (must read),
- and on-demand skills (read when trigger conditions apply).

### 3) Certification Gate

Before implementation:

- onboarding must be complete,
- read-integrity must be attested,
- and user approval must include `CERTIFY: APPROVED`.

### 4) Ticket-First Execution

Work is routed through:

- `attention_board.md` for active pointer routing,
- `tickets/` for durable execution memory,
- `artifact_board.md` for linked outputs.

The active ticket `## Notes` is the canonical memory stream for findings,
decisions, blockers, and evidence.

### 5) Compaction / Re-Entry

After compaction, handoff, or a new session:

- re-onboard using the same routing authority,
- rebuild context from board + ticket state,
- and re-certify before resuming action.

This prevents "performative compliance" and keeps behavior auditable.

## Role Model

Context Compass currently includes both software and fiction workflows.

The authoritative list is the registry table in `SKILLS.MD`. The lanes below are
a reader's overview and may lag the registry; when they disagree, the registry
wins.

### Software Lane

- `general`
- `engineer`
- `design_engineer`
- `platform_engineer`
- `qa_engineer`
- `security_engineer`

### Fiction Authoring Lane

- `story_designer`
- `story_novel_artist`
- `researcher`
- `draft_writer`
- `developmental_editor`
- `line_copy_editor`
- `continuity_fact_checker`
- `proofreader`

### User-Defined Lane

- `user_defined/<name>` overlays for team or personal specialization

## Configuration Authority

Two files with two distinct jobs.

**`SKILLS.MD` - the single role registry.**
One table declares every role: its `SKILLS.MD` path, its parent role, whether
it is user-defined, whether it is selectable after onboarding, and whether it
reads READMEs. A role exists if and only if it has a row there. Adding a role
is a one-row edit.

**`config/context_compass_config.yaml` - behaviour settings only.**
It does not enumerate roles and is never consulted to resolve one.

- `profiles.onboarding` for first-time onboarding state and transitions,
- `system_of_record.enforce` for whether agents may use their own harness's task
  tracking instead of this package (default `true`, meaning they may not),
- `workflow` for ticket microcycle behavior,
- `artifacts` for artifact retention rules,
- `documentation_format` for line length and evidence formatting,
- `reading` for read-window and chunking limits.

There is no stored active role. Role selection is per agent, per session, so
several agents can hold different roles in the same repository at once.

## Quick Start

1. Place `context_compass/` in your repository.
2. Ensure your agent reads `AGENTS.MD` at the repository root, or points its own
   entrypoint file at it.
3. Select a role from the role map in `SKILLS.MD`.
4. Start onboarding through `SKILLS.MD` role resolution.
5. Request `CERTIFY: APPROVED`.
6. Execute through ticket routing (`attention_board.md` + active ticket notes).

## Why Teams Use This

- Reproducible agent behavior across sessions.
- Explicit role specialization without policy fragmentation.
- Better handoffs and lower context-loss cost.
- Clear evidence trails for decisions and changes.
- Portable model across agent runtimes.

## Recommended Operating Discipline

- Keep role docs as delta layers (do not duplicate parent skills).
- Keep ticket notes high-signal and evidence-backed.
- Keep board rows routing-focused and concise.
- Treat compaction as a reliability event, not a convenience event.
- Prefer explicit blocker states over hidden assumptions.

## Public Library Intent

Context Compass is intended to be reusable by:

- solo builders,
- engineering teams,
- hybrid technical + creative workflows,
- and multi-agent pipelines that require deterministic process control.

If you extend this library, keep your routing manifest, role maps, and
certification gates explicit so downstream users inherit a stable system.
