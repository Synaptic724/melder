# üöÄ Proposed Hybrid Model: Dynamic Conduits + Scope Blueprints

## Core Ideas:

- **Default Dynamic Conduits**:  
  The primary and easiest way to use scopes remains the current plan: dynamically create a conduit instance using something like `spellbook.create_conduit()`.  
  This gives you a fresh scope boundary whenever you need one ‚Äî perfect for transient contexts.

- **Named Dynamic Conduits (as planned)**:  
  As already in your future plans, dynamically created conduits can be given names for easier access when needed.

- **Registered Scope Configurations / Blueprints (New Addition)**:  
  Introduce a system to define and register configurations (blueprints) for specific types of scopes.  
  These configurations act as templates describing what services (potentially with specific bindings or overrides) should be treated as **"Unique per Conduit"** within conduits created from that blueprint.

- **Instantiating from Blueprints**:  
  When creating a conduit, you could optionally specify that you want to create it based on a registered blueprint.  
  Example:

~~~
  conduit = spellbook.create_conduit(from_blueprint='request_scope_config')
~~~

  This would create a **dynamic conduit instance** pre-configured according to the `request_scope_config` blueprint.

- **Blueprint Behavior**:  
  The blueprint could define specific bindings and could also inherit/extend other blueprint configurations.  
  Example:  
  A `request_scope_config` blueprint might ensure that a `RequestLogger` service is always **"Unique per Conduit"**, potentially overriding any global "Unique" binding for `RequestLogger`.

## üß† Take on this Hybrid:

This hybrid model seems **much less confusing** than the previous idea of binding objects to static scope names.  
It doesn't invert the core mental model. Instead, it **adds a layer of reusable configuration** for dynamic scopes.

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

- **Reusable structured scope setups**:  
  Users can define complex, opinionated scope setups (like web request scopes, background job scopes) once and instantiate them easily.
  
- **Promotes consistency**:  
  Consistent application architecture without repetitive binding/setup code.

- **Extends naturally from Named Conduits**:  
  Moves from naming instances ‚Üí to naming "types" or "configurations" of conduits.

- **Powerful but optional**:  
  Doesn't force extra complexity into the basic dynamic conduit model ‚Äî keeps things simple by default.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity Considerations:

- **API Definition for Blueprints**:  
  Need to define a clear and intuitive API for registering, composing, and instantiating blueprints.

- **Binding Interaction Rules**:  
  Must carefully specify how blueprint-specific bindings:
  - Override global bindings.
  - Coexist with existing bindings.
  - Handle standard lifetime rules (Unique, Many, Unique per Conduit).

---

## üåü Final Thoughts:

This approach seems **very viable** and would be a **powerful advanced feature** layered naturally onto the core dynamic conduit model.  
It allows structured, reusable scope definitions without sacrificing flexibility or simplicity for everyday usage.  
It **aligns extremely well** with the goal of providing scalable features **without bloating** the basic experience.
